### Known Issues

#### `jruby-openssl` 0.15.4 Fails to Parse EC Keys

The `openssl` JRuby library included in this release may fail to parse some PEM
files that previous versions were able to parse, resulting in errors such as:

```console
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1Primitive org.bouncycastle.asn1.sec.ECPrivateKey.getParameters()'
```

Not all files are affected, the error seems to be triggered by specific patterns in
ASN.1 content. This issue is fixed in version 8.14.1.
